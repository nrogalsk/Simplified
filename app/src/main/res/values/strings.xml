    <!-- About Activity -->
    <string name="AboutUsParagraph01Title">About Simplified</string>
    <string name="AboutUsParagraph01_01Text">Simplified has been developed with simplification in mind. Apps these days are overcomplicated
    and sometimes have too many features; most of which we would never use.</string>
    <string name="AboutUsParagraph01_02Text">Simplified has extracted the weather we use most and presented them in one simple app.</string>
    <string name="AboutUsParagraph01_03Text">The team at Simplified had technophobic people in mind when the idea for this app came about.
        Whether you are an older person or someone who gets scared about using technology, Simplified wants to make it easy for someone to
        learn how to use apps without all the complicated features that most apps have these days.</string>

    <string name="AboutUsParagraph02Title">About the Developer</string>
    <string name="AboutUsParagraph02_01Text">The developer behdind Simplified is Nicole Rogalski.</string>
    <string name="AboutUsParagraph02_02Text">Nicole is a final year Computer Science and Software Engineering student at Deakin University.</string>
    <string name="AboutUsParagraph02_03Text">App development sparked her interest back at the beginning of her 2nd year when she chose an introductory
    app development elective.</string>
    <string name="AboutUsParagraph02_04Text">The idea behind Simplified came when she was teaching her grandmother who to use apps on an Android device she had recently
    bought but was overwhelmed with all the different types of apps and that you require more than one or two just to complete simple tasks.</string>
    <string name="AboutUsParagraph02_05Text">Any questions, please contact Nicole via email  nrogalsk@deakin.edu.au</string>
